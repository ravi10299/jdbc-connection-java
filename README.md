Here are the steps to create a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connection in Java:

1.Load the JDBC Driver:
You need to load the appropriate JDBC driver class using Class.forName() method. This step is necessary to register the driver with the DriverManager.

2.Establish Connection:
Use the DriverManager.getConnection() method to establish a connection to the database. Pass the JDBC URL, username, and password as parameters to this method.

3.Perform Database Operations:
After successfully establishing the connection, you can perform various database operations like executing SQL queries, updating data, etc.

4.Close the Connection:
It's important to close the connection once you're done using it to release database resources. You can close the connection using the close() method.
